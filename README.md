## Motivation 

This is a project undertaken by Meditation Teacher and Programmer, Aditya Patange to incorporate Mindfulness techniques and strategies into the process of software engineering, programming and creative expression. With this project, Aditya intends to help his students practice Mindfulness Techniques and Strategies during activities like writing code, designing systems, learning the Dhamma, communicating and sharing knowledge while simultaneously developing a spirit of love and service for all sentient beings. In simplified language, the objective is to make productive use of time and compress all the 8 Steps of the Buddha's path into the process of engineering, creation and invention!

It also aligns with his broader version of making Mindfulness Teachings, Spiritual Knowledge, and Buddhist Science accessible to people all over the globe by fusing Technology with Contemplative Sciences.

AnattƒÅ API is a start and will hopefully serve as a foundation or platform for application developers and product designers who intend to craft unique, and beneficial experiences for people. We encourage people to incorporate AnattƒÅ's features into their own practice, and craft novel products for themselves first, and then people.

Lastly, every line of code was written with Metta or Loving-Friendliness. May all sentient beings be well, happy and peaceful and may all the users of this API achieve spiritual success and liberation from suffering. A side-quest while working on this project is to actively drop into flow (as defined by the Unified Mindfulness System) and Zen bounce through every single micro-interaction with computers, and in the process learn to dynamically, skillfully and spontaneously respond to sensory experiences primarily driven by the union of human (consciousness) and machines.
